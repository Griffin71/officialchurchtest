    <h2>GUILD OF ST. MARY MAGDALENE</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p></p>
      The report serves to present an overview of the history of the Guild of St. Mary Magdalene, from its inception at the Parish of St. Francis of Assisi, Mamelodi West in 2013 that led up to its official inauguration in the Diocese of Pretoria in 2019.
    </p>
    <h3>Background of the Guild</h3>
    <p>
      The Guild of the St. Mary Magdalene was officially introduced and resurrected in the Parish of St. Francis of Assisi, Mamelodi West in September 2013 by members of the Guild of St. Mary Magdalene from the Diocese of Mbashe, with the assistance of Reverend Canon S.L Bam.
      There were fifteen young women who initially formed part of the Guild in its inception and Guild Prayer Sessions started soon after the visit from the Diocese of Mbashe in 2013 in preparation to take up the roles of administering the objectives of the guild.
      The Guild in the parish of St. Francis then raised funds for the trip to the Eastern Cape to attend the July 2014 conference of the Patron Saint Mary Magdalene in the Diocese of Mbashe.
      The executive of the parish of St. Francis of Assisi also embarked on growing the guild in the Diocese with the guidance and mentorship of Reverend S.L Bam, by honouring invites from the different parishes within the Diocese of Pretoria to introduce the guild and offer support on the correct procedures to follow in establishing themselves as new members of the guild.
    </p>
    <h3>Progress of the Guild at Diocese of Pretoria</h3>
    <p>
      The Diocese of Pretoria formally mobilised on 27 May 2017 by holding an Annual General Meeting with the main objective being to adopt the Constitution from the Provincial Constitution.
      The Diocese then hosted a workshop on 10 June 2017 at St. Albans Cathedral.
    </p>
    <strong>Purpose of the Workshop:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The main purpose of the workshop was to ensure uniformity in what we do, according to provincial standards and that the Diocese of Pretoria would align itself accordingly to the canons, rules and regulations of ACSA as stipulated.</li>
      <li>To clarify questions that were raised around the structure of the Guild.</li>
      <li>The Provincial Executive (President and Secretary) came to address these questions and to keep us abreast of the progress made on the Provincial level.</li>
      <li>To get in-depth understanding of the requirements of Synod and proper steps to take for the Guild to be recognised in the Diocese.</li>
      <li>Election of Interim Executive Committee, Maggy Leshaba served as President.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Interim Diocesan Executive Committee was mandated to finalise the Constitution and thus attain recognition for the Guild in the Diocese of Pretoria.
      The elected DEXCO then wrote to the Bishop to request a meeting on June 15, 2017. The first meeting to introduce the Guild and request permission from the Bishop to continue with the Ministry in the Diocese was held in early 2017, with a follow up meeting with the Bishop on 13 December 2017. This has since proved to be rewarding, hence the Guild was advised to present the constitution first with the Diocesan Standing Committee as the Guild was fairly new and not yet known within the Diocese.
      A letter to request recognition; a list of Guilders and a draft of the constitution were submitted to the Bishop’s Office on 22 January 2018, following our meeting in December 2017.
      The Ad Clerum dated 27 June 2017 issued by the Bishop assisted in giving guidelines to Parishes in the establishment of the Guild and set the boundaries under which the Ministry can continue to steadily grow in numbers.
      The Constitution, adopted on 27 May 2017 was reviewed on 06 April 2018 by the Diocesan Chancellor in a formal meeting, present in the meeting was the Interim President – Magdeline Leshaba, Deputy President – Naome Kganyago and Reverend Siphiwo Bam. This was a recommendation made after the acceptance of our proposal for recognition at the Diocesan Standing Committee on 10 February 2018.
      The Bishop appointed a committee (consisting of DEXCO members; Interim President Magdeline Leshaba and Deputy President Naome Kganyago with DSC members, being The Venerable Danny Z. Adonis and Dr Mike Van der Linde) to review the constitution. The committee proceeded to work on the constitution on a full-time basis with meetings held at least twice a week from November 2018 to January 2019.
    </p>
    <h3>In Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Finally, the acknowledgement of the Guild by the Diocesan Standing Committee, with the adoption of the Constitution on 09 February 2019, led to the official conference and signing of official constitution of the Guild of St. Mary Magdalene on 21 July 2019.
